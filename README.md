# RSX_OCR
Optical Character Recognition of text on a terminal/computer screen.

This project is being created for RSX as a part of the Autonomy subteam. The intent is to have a camera be able to read text off of a terminal/screen and process it into text data to be read off using TTS.

Libraries: OpenCV, Pytesseract
